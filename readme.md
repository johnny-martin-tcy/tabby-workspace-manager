- Create a `node_modules` folder in the `plugins` folder, if it does not already exist

## General

<p>
The plugin adds a new tab in Tabby's settings. It is possible to add, delete and edit workspace profiles here. Additionally, you can add a default profile and enable it on the terminal startup (upper right corner). In the hotkeys tab, it is possible to set keyboard shortcuts for the first five workspace profiles.
